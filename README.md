# TTDS Group Project

## Wikipedia-Based Image Search

Fully functional Search-engine that was developed from scractch for the TTDS group coursework project. It is a wiki-image search-engine to be specific. Data was collected for all of the images and corresponding captions from English Wikipedia. A search-engine was then developed which effectively finds images with captions related to the user's query using TFIDF bag-of-words features. It incorporates some novel technqiues such as LLM-based query expansion to enhance the relevance of the user search.
