Albert Sidney Johnston.jpg","At about 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm, while leading one of those charges against a U.S. camp near the &quot;Peach Orchard&quot;, he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. The bullet clipped a part of his [[popliteal artery]], and his boot filled up with blood. No medical personnel were on the scene since Johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded Confederate troops and U.S. prisoners earlier in the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;civilwarlandscapes.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Battlefield Tours: Full Tour Shiloh|url=http://www.civilwarlandscapes.org/cwla/states/tn/sh/ftour/1jd.htm|website=Civil War Landscapes Association|access-date=February 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102161211/http://civilwarlandscapes.org/cwla/states/tn/sh/ftour/1jd.htm|archive-date=November 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mosler sketch, Death of Gen.

Johnston Shiloh Monument.jpg,"Within a few minutes, Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting. Among his staff was [[Isham G. Harris]], the [[Governor of Tennessee]], who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that [[Abraham Lincoln]] had appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as military governor of Tennessee. Seeing Johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale, Harris asked: &quot;General, are you wounded?&quot; Johnston glanced down at his leg wound, then faced Harris and said his last words in a weak voice: &quot;Yes... and I fear seriously.&quot; Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse, carried him to a small ravine near the &quot;Hornets Nest&quot;, and desperately tried to aid the general, who had lost consciousness. Harris then sent an aide to fetch Johnston's surgeon but did not apply a [[tourniquet]] to Johnston's wounded leg. A few minutes later, Johnston died from blood loss before a doctor could be found. It is believed that Johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound. Ironically, it was later discovered that Johnston had a tourniquet in his pocket when he died.&lt;ref name=&quot;civilwarlandscapes.org&quot; /&gt;[[File:Johnston Shiloh Monument.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Johnston at [[Shiloh National Military Park]]]]Harris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston's body in a blanket to not damage the troops' morale with the sight of the dead general. Johnston and his wounded horse, Fire Eater, were taken to his field headquarters on the Corinth road, where his body remained in his tent for the remainder of the battle. P. G. T. Beauregard assumed command of the army. He resumed leading the Confederate assault, which continued advancing and pushed the U.S. forces back to a final defensive line near the Tennessee river. With his army exhausted and daylight almost gone, Beauregard called off the final Confederate attack around 1900 hours, figuring he could finish off the U.S. army the following morning. However, Grant was reinforced by 20,000 fresh troops from [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s [[Army of the Ohio]] during the night and led a successful counter-attack the following day, driving the Confederates from the field and winning the battle. As the Confederate army retreated to Corinth, Johnston's body was taken to the home of Colonel William Inge, which had been his headquarters in Corinth. It was covered in the Confederate flag and lay in state for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;Sword, pp. 270‚Äì73, 443‚Äì46; Cunningham, pp. 273‚Äì76; Smith, pp. 26‚Äì34.

For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing &quot;For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all&quot; they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin.

Also, while it is comprehensible to people from the [[Maghreb]], a linguistically innovative variety such as [[Moroccan Arabic]] is essentially incomprehensible to Arabs from the [[Mashriq]], much as French is incomprehensible to Spanish or Italian speakers but relatively easily learned by them.

The main dialectal division is between the varieties within and outside of the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian peninsula]], followed by that between [[Varieties of Arabic#Typological differences|sedentary]] varieties and the much more conservative [[Bedouin]] varieties. All the varieties outside of the Arabian peninsula, which include the large majority of speakers, have many features in common with each other that are not found in Classical Arabic. This has led researchers to postulate the existence of a prestige [[Koin√© language|koine]] dialect in the one or two centuries immediately following the [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab conquest]], whose features eventually spread to all newly conquered areas. These features are present to varying degrees inside the Arabian peninsula.

Sobrero strongly opposed the use of nitroglycerin because it was unpredictable, exploding when subjected to variable heat or pressure. But Nobel became interested in finding a way to control and use [[nitroglycerin]] as a commercially usable explosive; it had much more power than [[gunpowder]].

Recent research shows that traits usually used to distinguish taxa at this time were actually widespread across several taxa, causing many of the taxa named to be invalid, like ''Atlantosaurus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Two years later, Marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen (YPM VP 1980) from [[Como Bluff]], [[Wyoming]], he gave this specimen the name ''Brontosaurus excelsus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;marsh1879&quot; /&gt; Also at Como Bluff, the Hubbell brothers working for Edward Drinker Cope collected a tibia, fibula, scapula, and several caudal vertebrae along with other fragments belonging to ''Apatosaurus'' in 1877‚Äì78 at Cope's Quarry 5 at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007 |title=Apatosaurus sp.

After his defeat, Tissaphernes was executed and replaced as satrap by [[Tithraustes]], who gave Agesilaus 30 talents to move north to the satrapy of Pharnabazus (Persian satraps were often bitter rivals).&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, ''Sparta's Bitter Victories'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 216, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Augesilaus' Phrygian campaign of 394 was fruitless, as he lacked the siege equipment required to take the fortresses of Leonton Kephalai, [[Gordion]], and Miletou Teichos.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:PERSIA, Achaemenid Empire. temp.

He was perfectly single-minded and unrelenting in the onslaught of battle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dares Phrygius]], ''History of the Fall of Troy'' [https://www.theoi.com/Text/DaresPhrygius.html 13]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, In Homer's ''Iliad'' he is described as of great stature, colossal frame, and strongest of all the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]. Known as the &quot;bulwark of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+6.5 6.5].&lt;/ref&gt; he was trained by the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] (who had trained Ajax's father Telamon and Achilles' father [[Peleus]] and later died of an accidental wound inflicted by [[Heracles]], whom he was training at the same time as Achilles). He was described as fearless, strong, and powerful but also with a very high level of combat intelligence. Ajax commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cowhides with a layer of bronze. Most notably, Ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the ''Iliad'', and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods (except for Agamemnon) who take part in the battles, although, in book 13, [[Poseidon]] strikes Ajax with his staff, renewing his strength. Unlike [[Diomedes]], [[Agamemnon]], and [[Achilles]], Ajax appears as a mainly defensive warrior, instrumental in the defense of the Greek camp and ships and that of [[Patroclus]]' body. When the Trojans are on the offensive, he is often seen covering the retreat of the Achaeans. Significantly, while one of the deadliest heroes in the whole poem, Ajax has no [[aristeia]] depicting him on the offensive.[[File: The Belvedere Torso depicting Ajax.jpg|thumb|The [[Belvedere Torso]], a marble sculpture carved in the first century BC depicting Ajax.]]"

By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200&amp;nbsp;years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl 1997, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HW286&quot;&gt;Wolfram 1997, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarnut 1995, pp. 29‚Äì30&lt;/ref&gt;"

Although the copy has been lost, the [[Andrea Bianco]] original is preserved at the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] (Venice).]]When the campaigns in Africa were over, Afonso V found new grounds for battle in neighboring [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. On 11 December 1474 King [[Henry IV of Castile]] died without a male heir, leaving just one daughter, [[Joanna la Beltraneja|Joanna]]. However, her paternity was questioned; it was rumored that his wife, Queen [[Joan of Portugal]] (Afonso's sister) had an affair with a nobleman named [[Beltr√°n de La Cueva]]. The death of Henry ignited a [[War of the Castilian Succession|war of succession]] with one faction supporting Joanna and the other supporting [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]], Henry's half-sister. Afonso V was persuaded to intervene on behalf of Joanna, his niece. He betrothed himself to her, proclaimed himself king of Castile and led troops into the kingdom. Because of their close blood-relationship, a formal marriage had to wait for papal dispensation.&lt;ref name=Rubin&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rubin |first1=Nancy |title=Isabella of Castile: The First Renaissance Queen |date=1991 |publisher=St. Martin's Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

Juliusz Kossak - Amazonka.jpg,"Apart from the artistic desire to express the passionate womanhood of the Amazons in contrast with the manhood of their enemies, some modern historians interpret the popularity of Amazon in art as indicators of societal trends, both positive and negative. Greek and Roman societies, however, utilized the Amazon mythology as a literary and artistic vehicle to unite against a commonly-held enemy. The metaphysical characteristics of Amazons were seen as personifications of both nature and religion. Roman authors like Virgil, Strabo, Pliny the Elder, Curtius, Plutarch, Arrian, and Pausanius advocated the greatness of the state, as Amazon myths served to discuss the creation of origin and identity for the Roman people. However, that changed over time. Amazons in Roman literature and art have many faces, such as the ''Trojan ally, the warrior goddess, the native Latin, the warmongering Celt, the proud Sarmatian, the hedonistic and passionate Thracian warrior queen, the subdued Asian city, and the worthy Roman foe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wissenschaft.de/magazin/weitere-themen/auf-den-spuren-penthesileias/    |title= Die Amazonen zwischen Mythos und Realit√§t - Auf den Spuren Penthesileias  |date= August 19, 2010 | publisher= Wissenschaft DE | author= Jochen Fornasier  | access-date= January 17, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=honorstheses  |title= The Amazon in Greek Art |date= March 22, 2012  | publisher= Portland State University | author=Annaliese Elaine Patten     | access-date= February 3, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ancient.eu/article/353/roman-interpretations-of-the-amazons-through-liter/  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190520062034/https://www.ancient.eu/article/353/roman-interpretations-of-the-amazons-through-liter/  |url-status= dead  |archive-date= May 20, 2019  |title= Roman Interpretations of the Amazons through Literature and Art |date= March 22, 2012  | publisher= Ancient EU | author=Erin W.

Though, as explained in ''Divina Virago'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright has given a detailed account of the bad reputation Amazons had in the Renaissance.

These operations are ''compounding'' (or the addition of one idea onto another, such as a horn on a horse to create a [[unicorn]]); ''transposing'' (or the substitution of one part of a thing with the part from another, such as with the body of a man upon a horse to make a [[centaur]]); ''augmenting'' (as with the case of a [[giant (mythology)|giant]], whose size has been augmented); and ''diminishing'' (as with [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputians]], whose size has been diminished). (Hume 1974:317) In a later chapter, he also mentions the operations of ''mixing'', ''separating'', and ''dividing''. (Hume 1974:340) [[File:Missing blue shade.svg|thumb|Fig. 1.

According to Raja Sen of Rediff.com, &quot;Amitabh Bachchan, a retired lawyer with bipolar disorder, takes up cudgels on behalf of the girls, delivering courtroom blows with pugilistic grace. As we know from Prakash Mehra movies, in each life some Bachchan must fall. The girls hang on to him with incredulous desperation, and he bats for them with all he has. At one point Meenal hangs by Bachchan's elbow, words entirely unnecessary. Bachchan towers through Pink ‚Äì the way he bellows &quot;et cetera&quot; is alone worth having the heavy-hitter at play‚Äîbut there are softer moments like one where he appears to have dozed off in court, or where he lays his head by his convalescent wife's bedside and needs his hair ruffled and his conviction validated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/review-pink-a-film-that-must-be-championed/20160916.htm |title=Review: Pink, a film that must be championed |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-date=22 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722011437/http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/review-pink-a-film-that-must-be-championed/20160916.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', noted film critic and author [[Anupama Chopra]] said of Bachchan's performance, &quot;A special salute to Amitabh Bachchan, who imbues his character with a tragic majesty.

Amaury Coin (1163-1174).jpg,"Baldwin III died on 10 February 1163 and the kingdom passed to Amalric, although there was some opposition among the nobility to Agnes; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir, but now the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'' refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=299}} [[File:Amaury Coin (1163-1174).jpg|thumb|Coin of Amaury (1163-1174): Amaury and his successors used the Holy Sepulchre on the obverse image for their deniers as a way of strengthening their relationship with the church where they were both crowned and buried. This helped to reinforce the legitimacy of the dynasty's claims to the Kingdom of Jerusalem.]] The hostility to Agnes, it must be admitted, may be exaggerated by the chronicler [[William of Tyre]], whom she prevented from becoming [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]] decades later, as well as from William's continuators like [[Ernoul]], who hints at a slight on her moral character: &quot;car telle n'est que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de Jherusalem&quot; (&quot;there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as Jerusalem&quot;). Nevertheless, consanguinity was enough for the opposition. Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife, although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fief's income. Agnes soon thereafter married [[Hugh of Ibelin]], to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with Amalric. The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes' children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession. Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;images.library.wisc.edu&quot;&gt;Baldwin, Marshall W.

According to the legend current for centuries throughout the civilized world, Abgar Ukkama wrote to Jesus, inviting him to visit him at Edessa to heal him from sickness. In return he received the blessing of Jesus and subsequently was converted by the evangelist Addai. There is, however, no factual evidence for Christianity at Edessa before the reign of Abgar the Great, 150 years later. Scholars are generally agreed that the legend has confused the two Abgars. It cannot be proved that Abgar the Great adopted Christianity; but his friend Bardai·π£an was a heterodox Christian, and there was a church at Edessa in 201.

The most common description is that of a kangaroo-like creature with the face of a horse, the head of a dog, leathery bat-like wings, horns, small arms with clawed hands, red eyes, cloven hooves and a forked tail. It has been reported to move quickly, as to avoid human contact, and often is described as emitting a &quot;blood-curdling scream&quot;.&lt;ref name=mccloy&gt;''The Jersey Devil'', by James F.

An aircraft flying at {{convert|1000|km/h|mph}} is moving at a rate of about {{convert|280|m/s|foot/s}}. This means the aircraft will have moved hundreds of meters during the flight time of the shells, greatly complicating the aiming problem to the point where close passes were essentially impossible to aim using manual gunsights. This speed also allowed the aircraft to rapidly fly out of range of the guns; even if the aircraft passes directly over the SPAAG, it would be within its firing radius for under 30 seconds."

For this purpose, they select the most capable house in the vicinity because many people are expected to attend the event. The diviner hangs his bed in the middle and places an infernal potion, known as ayahuasca, by his side, which is particularly effective at altering one's senses. They prepare a brew from bitter vines or herbs, which, when boiled sufficiently, must become quite potent. Since it's so strong at altering one's judgment in small quantities, the precaution is not excessive, and it fits into two small pots. The witch doctor drinks a very small amount each time and knows well how many times he can sample the brew without losing his senses to properly conduct the ritual and lead the choir&quot;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Another report produced in 1737 by the missionary [[Pablo Maroni]], describes the use of a psychoactive liana called ayahuasca for divination in the [[Napo River]], Ecuador:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maroni |first=Pablo |title=Noticias aut√©nticas del famoso R√≠o Mara√±√≥n y misi√≥n apost√≥lica de la Compa√±√≠a de Jes√∫s de la Provincia de Quito en los dilatados bosques de dicho r√≠o, escrib√≠alas por los a√±os de 1738, un misionero de la misma compa√±√≠a |publisher=Iquitos: Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazon√≠a Peruana (IIAP) |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Ayahuasca and chacruna cocinando.jpg|thumb|right|Ayahuasca cooking]]&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;For divination, they use a beverage, some of [[Datura|white datura]] flowers, which they also call Campana due to its shape, and others from a vine commonly known as Ayahuasca, both highly effective at numbing the senses and even at taking one's life if taken in excess. They also occasionally use these substances for the treatment of common illnesses, especially headaches. So, the person who wants to divine drinks the chosen substance with certain rituals, and while deprived of their senses from the mouth downwards, to prevent the strength of the plant from harming them, they remain in this state for many hours and sometimes even two or three days until the effects run their course, and the intoxication subsides. After this, they reflect on what their imagination revealed, which occasionally remains with them for delirium. This is what they consider accomplished and propagate as an oracle.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Latter reports were produced by [[Juan Magnin]] in 1740, describing ayahuasca use as a medicinal plant by the [[Jivaroan peoples]] (called ''ayahuessa'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Magnin |first=Juan |title=Breve descripci√≥n de la provincia de Quito, en la Am√©rica Meridional, y de sus missiones de Succumb√≠os de religiosos de S.

Anointing oil.jpg,"[[File:Anointing oil.jpg|thumb|[[R. W.

The rite would be similar to that of Pentecostals in its simplicity, but would usually not have the same emotionalism attached to it. Unlike some Pentecostals, Evangelicals and Fundamentalists generally do not believe that physical healing is within the anointing. Therefore, God may or may not grant physical healing to the sick. The healing conferred by anointing is thus a spiritual event that may not result in physical recovery."

Ottomans 1875.png,"Also in 1867, Abdulaziz became the first Ottoman Sultan to formally recognize the title of [[Khedive]] (Viceroy) to be used by the Governor of the [[Egypt Eyalet|Ottoman Eyalet of Egypt and Sudan]] (1517‚Äì1867), which thus became the autonomous [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt and Sudan]] (1867‚Äì1914). [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] and his descendants had been the governors of Ottoman Egypt and Sudan since 1805, but were willing to use the higher title of Khedive, which was unrecognized by the Ottoman government until 1867. In return, the first Khedive, [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]], had agreed a year earlier (in 1866) to increase the annual tax revenues which Egypt and Sudan would provide for the Ottoman treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;OttomanDebt&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mevzuatdergisi.com/2006/04a/03.htm| title = Mevzuat Dergisi, Yƒ±l: 9, Sayƒ±: 100, Nisan 2006: &quot;Osmanlƒ± ƒ∞mparatorluƒüu'nda ve T√ºrkiye Cumhuriyeti'nde Bor√ßlanma Politikalarƒ± ve Sonu√ßlarƒ±&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1854 and 1894,&lt;ref name=&quot;OttomanDebt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lausanne18&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne| title = Article 18 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the revenues from Egypt and Sudan were often declared as a [[surety]] by the Ottoman government for borrowing loans from British and French banks.&lt;ref name=&quot;OttomanDebt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lausanne18&quot; /&gt; [[File:Ottomans 1875.png|left|thumb|221x221px|The [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1875]]Abdulaziz gave special emphasis on modernizing the [[Ottoman Navy]]. In 1875, the Ottoman Navy had 21 battleships and 173 warships of other types, ranking as the third largest navy in the world after the British and French navies. His passion for the Navy, ships and sea can be observed in the wall paintings and pictures of the [[Beylerbeyi Palace]], which was constructed during his reign. However, the large budget for modernizing and expanding the Navy (combined with a severe drought in 1873 and incidents of flooding in 1874 which damaged Ottoman agriculture and reduced the government's tax revenues) contributed to the financial difficulties which caused the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] to declare a [[sovereign default]] with the &quot;Ramazan Kanunnamesi&quot; on 30 October 1875. The subsequent decision to increase agricultural taxes for paying the [[Ottoman public debt]] to foreign creditors (mainly British and French banks) triggered the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] in the [[Rumelia|empire's Balkan provinces]]. The crisis culminated in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì78)]] that devastated the already struggling Ottoman economy, and the establishment of the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]] in 1881, during the early years of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdulhamid II]]'s reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;OttomanDebt&quot; /&gt;"

The system of columns supporting double arcades of piers and arches with alternating red and white voussoirs is an unusual treatment that, structurally, combined striking visual effect with the practical advantage of providing greater height within the hall. Alternating red and white voussoirs are associated with Umayyad monuments such as the Great Mosque of Damascus and the Dome of the Rock.

Aelbert Cuyp-The Negro Page.jpg,"Cuyp's &quot;van Goyen phase&quot; can be placed approximately in the early 1640s. Cuyp probably first encountered a painting by van Goyen in 1640 when van Goyen was, as Stephen Reiss points, out &quot;at the height of [his] powers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiss_8&quot; /&gt; This is noticeable in the comparison between two of Cuyp's landscape paintings inscribed 1639 where no properly formed style is apparent and the landscape backgrounds he painted two years later for two of his father's group portraits that are distinctly van Goyenesque. Cuyp took from van Goyen the straw yellow and light brown tones that are so apparent in his ''Dunes'' (1629) and the broken brush technique also very noticeable in that same work. This technique, a precursor to [[impressionism]], is noted for the short brush strokes where the colors are not necessarily blended smoothly. In Cuyp's ''River Scene, Two Men Conversing'' (1641) both of these van Goyen-influenced stylistic elements are noticeable.[[File:Aelbert Cuyp-The Negro Page.jpg|thumb|''The Negro Page'', circa 1652, [[Royal Collection]]|left|260x260px]]"
Aelbert Cuyp - Piping Shepherds (Metropolitan Museum of Art).jpg,"In this new form of lighting, the artist (and viewer of the painting) faced the sun more or less contre-jour. Both, and subsequently Cuyp, used the advantages of this new lighting style to alter the sense of depth and luminosity possible in a painting. To make notice of these new capabilities, much use was made of elongated shadows. Cuyp was one of the first Dutch painters to appreciate this new leap forward in style and while his own Both-inspired phase was quite short (limited to the mid-1640s) he did, more than any other contemporary Dutch artist, maximize the full chromatic scale for sunsets and sunrises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiss_8&quot; /&gt;[[File:Aelbert Cuyp - Piping Shepherds (Metropolitan Museum of Art).jpg|thumbnail|''Piping Shepherds'', Metropolitan Museum of Art|260x260px]]Cuyp's third stylistic phase (which occurred throughout his career) is based on the influence of his father. While it is assumed that the younger Cuyp did work with his father initially to develop rudimentary talents, Aelbert became more focused on landscape paintings while Jacob was a portrait painter by profession. As has been mentioned and as will be explained in depth below, there are pieces where Aelbert provided the landscape background for his father's portraits. What is meant by stating that Aelbert learned from his father is that his eventual transition from a specifically landscape painter to the involvement of foreground figures is attributed to his interaction with his father Jacob. The evidence for Aelbert's evolution to foreground figure painter is in the production of some paintings from 1645 to 1650 featuring foreground animals that do not fit with Jacob's style.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reiss|Reiss (1975)]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the confusion regarding Aelbert's stylistic development and the problem of attribution is of course the fact that Jacob's style was not stagnant either. Their converging styles make it difficult to exactly understand the influences each had on the other, although it is clear enough to say that Aelbert started representing large scale forms (something he had not done previously) and placing animals as the focus of his paintings (something that was specific to him)."
Cuyp - Schafherde auf der Weide - St√§del.jpg,"Sunlight in his paintings rakes across the panel, accentuating small bits of detail in the golden light. In large, atmospheric panoramas of the countryside, the highlights on a blade of meadow grass, the mane of a tranquil horse, the horn of a dairy cow reclining by a stream, or the tip of a peasant's hat are all caught in a bath of yellow ocher light. The richly [[varnish]]ed medium refracts the rays of light like a jewel as it dissolves into numerous glazed layers. Cuyp's landscapes were based on reality and on his own invention of what an enchanting landscape should be.[[File:Cuyp - Schafherde auf der Weide - St√§del.jpg|thumb|''Herd of Sheep at Pasture'', 1650, [[St√§delsches Kunstinstitut]]|260x260px]]Cuyp's drawings reveal him to be a [[drawing|draftsman]] of superior quality.

The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea.

Solarmadrededeus2.JPG,"Since 1976, the Azores has been an autonomous region integrated within the framework of the Portuguese Republic. It has its own government and autonomous legislature within its own political-administrative statute and organic law. Its governmental organs include: the legislative assembly, a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament composed of 52 elected deputies, elected by universal [[suffrage]] for a four-year term; the regional government and presidency, with parliamentary legitimacy, composed of a president, a vice-president and seven regional secretaries responsible for day-to-day operations. It is represented in the Council of Ministers by a representative appointed by the president of the Republic, which was created during the revision of the constitution of 2004 (which, among other things, removed the older Portuguese representative that was appointed by the president of the Republic, beholden to the Council of State and coincident with the president). Since becoming a Portuguese autonomous region, the executive branch of the regional authority has been located in [[Ponta Delgada]], the legislative branch in [[Horta, Azores|Horta]], and the judicial branch in [[Angra do Hero√≠smo]].[[File:Solarmadrededeus2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Madre de Deus Manor]] is the seat of the [[:pt:Representante da Rep√∫blica nos A√ßores|Representative of the Republic]].]]"

Piero di Cosimo 025.jpg,"After fifteen years of this life, at the age of thirty-five, Anthony determined to withdraw from the habitations of men and retire in absolute solitude. He went into the desert to a mountain by the [[Nile]] called [[Dayr al-Maym≈´n|Pispir]] (now Der-el-Memun), opposite [[Faiyum|Arsino√´]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} There he lived strictly enclosed in an old abandoned [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] fort for some 20 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ButlerLives1991&quot; /&gt; Food was thrown to him over the wall. He was at times visited by pilgrims, whom he refused to see; but gradually a number of would-be disciples established themselves in caves and in huts around the mountain. Thus, a colony of ascetics was formed, who begged Anthony to come forth and be their guide in the spiritual life. Eventually, he yielded to their importunities and, about the year 305, emerged from his retreat. To the surprise of all, he appeared to be not emaciated, but healthy in mind and body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler&quot; /&gt;[[File:Piero di Cosimo 025.jpg|thumb|261px|Painting of Saint Anthony, a part of ''The Visitation with [[Saint Nicholas]] and Saint Anthony Abbot'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]], {{c.|lk=no|1480}}]]For five or six years he devoted himself to the instruction and organization of the great body of monks that had grown up around him; but then he once again withdrew into the inner desert that lay between the Nile and the Red Sea, near the shore of which he fixed his abode on a mountain ([[Mount Colzim]]) where still stands the monastery that bears his name, [[Monastery of Saint Anthony|Der Mar Antonios]]. Here he spent the last forty-five years of his life, in a seclusion, not so strict as Pispir, for he freely saw those who came to visit him, and he used to cross the desert to Pispir with considerable frequency. Amid the [[Diocletian Persecutions]], around 311 Anthony went to [[Alexandria]] and was conspicuous visiting those who were imprisoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler&quot; /&gt;"

Brunei territorial lose (1400‚Äì1890).gif,"[[File:Brunei territorial lose (1400‚Äì1890).gif|thumb|left|Brunei territorial losses from 1400 to 1890]] Brunei briefly rose to prominence in Southeast Asia when the Portuguese occupied [[Malacca]] and thereby forced the wealthy and powerful but displaced Muslim refugees there to relocate to nearby Sultanates such as Brunei. The Bruneian Sultan then intervened in a territorial conflict between [[Kingdom of Tondo|Hindu Tondo]] and [[Kingdom of Maynila|Muslim Manila]] in the Philippines by appointing the Bruneian descended [[Rajah Matanda|Rajah Ache]] of Manila as admiral of the Bruneian navy in a rivalry against Tondo and as the enforcer of Bruneian interests in the Philippines. He subsequently encountered the Magellan expedition&lt;ref&gt;de Aganduru Moriz, Rodrigo (1882). Historia general de las Islas Occidentales a la Asia adyacentes, llamadas Philipinas. Colecci√≥n de Documentos in√©ditos para la historia de Espa√±a, v.78‚Äì79. Madrid: Impr. de Miguel Ginesta.&lt;/ref&gt; wherein [[Antonio Pigafetta]] noted that under orders from his grandfather the Sultan of Brunei, Ache had previously sacked the Buddhist city of Loue in Southwest Borneo for being faithful to the old religion and rebelling against the authority of Sultanate.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Harrisson, Brunei's Two (or More) Capitals, Brunei Museum Journal, Vol. 3, No. 4 (1976), p. 77 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Colonialism|European influence]] gradually brought an end to Brunei's [[regional power]], as Brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. In the face of these invasions by European Christian powers, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Caliphate]] aided the beleaguered Southeast Asian Sultanates by making [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh|Aceh]] a [[protectorate]] and sending expeditions to reinforce, train and equip the local [[mujahideen]].&lt;ref&gt;Kayadibi, Saim. &quot;Ottoman Connections to the Malay World: Islam, Law and Society&quot;, (Kuala Lumpur: The Other Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Turks were routinely migrating to Brunei as evidenced by the complaints of Manila Oidor Melchor Davalos who in his 1585 report, say that Turks were coming to Sumatra, Borneo and Ternate every year, including defeated veterans from the [[Battle of Lepanto]].&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Davalos to the King, Manila 20 June 1585, in Lewis Hanke, Cuerpo de Documentos del Siglo XVI sobre los derechos de Espa√±a en las Indias y las Filipinas (Mexico 1977), pp 72, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Turks assisting Brunei against Habsburg Spain, makes the subsequent [[Castille War]] a part of the [[Ottoman‚ÄìHabsburg wars]]."

Hootenanny singers 1967.jpg,"Before gaining international recognition with [[ABBA]], Ulvaeus was a member of the Swedish folk-[[schlager]] band [[Hootenanny Singers]], known earlier as the &quot;West Bay Singers&quot;, who had an enormous following in [[Scandinavia]]. While on the road in southern Sweden in 1966, they encountered the [[Hep Stars]], and Ulvaeus quickly became friends with the group's keyboard player, [[Benny Andersson]]. The two musicians shared a passion for songwriting, and each found a composing partner in the other. On meeting again that summer, they composed their first song together: &quot;Isn't It Easy To Say&quot;, a song soon to be recorded by Andersson's group. The two continued teaming up for music, helping out each other's bands in the recording studio, and adding guitar or keyboards respectively to the recordings. In 1968, they composed two songs together: &quot;A Flower in My Garden&quot;, recorded by [[Hep Stars]], and their first real hit &quot;Ljuva Sextiotal&quot;, performed by popular Swedish artist [[Brita Borg]], for which [[Stig Anderson]] wrote lyrics. The latter, a cabar√©t-style ironic song about the 1960s, was submitted for the 1969 Swedish heats for the [[Eurovision]] Song Contest, but was rejected; it was later recorded by diva [[Brita Borg]]. Another hit came in 1969 with &quot;Speleman&quot;, also recorded by Hep Stars.[[File:Hootenanny singers 1967.jpg|thumb|left|Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus (second from right) with [[Hootenanny Singers]], 1967]]"

Braille Writer.jpg,"[[File:Braille Writer.jpg|thumb|Braille typewriter]]Braille may be produced by hand using a [[slate and stylus]] in which each dot is created from the back of the page, writing in mirror image, or it may be produced on a [[braille typewriter]] or [[Perkins Brailler]], or an electronic Brailler or braille notetaker. Braille users with access to smartphones may also activate the on-screen braille input keyboard, to type braille symbols on to their device by placing their fingers on to the screen according to the dot configuration of the symbols they wish to form. These symbols are automatically translated into print on the screen. The different tools that exist for writing braille allow the braille user to select the method that is best for a given task. For example, the [[slate and stylus]] is a portable writing tool, much like the pen and paper for the sighted. Errors can be erased using a braille eraser or can be overwritten with all six dots ({{bc|‚†ø}}). ''Interpoint'' refers to braille printing that is offset, so that the paper can be embossed on both sides, with the dots on one side appearing between the divots that form the dots on the other."

Smith said this vision occurred on the evening of September 21, 1823, and that on the following day, via divine guidance, he located the burial location of the plates on this hill and was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the same hill on September 22 of the following year to receive further instructions, which repeated annually for the next three years.{{sfn|Bushman|2005|pp=43‚Äì46}}{{sfn|Remini|2002|p=47}} Smith told his entire immediate family about this angelic encounter by the next night, and his brother William reported that the family &quot;believed all he [Joseph Smith] said&quot; about the angel and plates.{{sfn|Bushman|2005|pp=45‚Äì46}}[[File:The Hill Cumorah by C.C.A.

Many share some basic characteristics centering around reading words which miraculously appear, such as Jesee Knight's account: &quot;Now the way he translated was he put the urim and thummim into his hat and Darkned his Eyes then he would take a sentance and it would appear in Brite Roman Letters. Then he would tell the writer and he would write it. Then that would go away the next sentance would Come and so on.&quot; See {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=72}} for Knight's account and {{Harvtxt|Hardy|2020|pp=209‚Äì210}} for an interpretation arguing for this understanding of Smith's experience. Hardy contends understanding Smith reading a text best accounts for the documentary evidence of how he dictated and how his scribes wrote. Nevertheless, scholar Ann Taves points out that although such accounts share major characteristics, they are not fully consistent with each other. She hypothesizes &quot;observers made ''inferences'' about what Smith was experiencing based on what they saw, what they learned from discussion with Smith, what they believed, or some combination thereof&quot; and that accounts of what Smith did or did not see as he dictated do not necessarily describe Smith's experience (emphasis added). See {{Harvtxt|Taves|2020|p=177}} In light of this, other scholars have hypothesized Smith's ecstatic experience as a translator was more like &quot;panoramic visions&quot; than reading, which he then orally described to his scribes. See {{Harvtxt|Brown|2020|p=146}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, Smith sometimes separated himself from his scribe with a blanket between them, as he did while Martin Harris, a neighbor, scribed his dictation in 1828.{{sfn|Remini|2002|p=62}}{{sfn|Bushman|2005|pp=66, 71|ps=. &quot;When Martin Harris had taken dictation from Joseph, they at first hung a blanket between them to prevent Harris from inadvertently catching a glimpse of the plates, which were open on a table in the room.&quot;}} At other points in the process, such as when [[Oliver Cowdery]] or Emma Smith scribed, the plates were left covered up but in the open.{{sfn|Bushman|2005|p=71|ps=. &quot;When Cowdrey took up the job of scribe, he and Joseph translated in the same room where Emma was working. Joseph looked in the seerstone, and the plates lay covered on the table.&quot;}} During some dictation sessions the plates were entirely absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sweat|first=Anthony|date=2015|title=The Role of Art in Teaching Latter-day Saint History and Doctrine|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/vol-16-no-3-2015/role-art-teaching-latter-day-saint-history-doctrine|journal=[[Religious Educator]]|volume=16|pages=40‚Äì57}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Taves|2014|p=5}}[[File:JosephSmithTranslating.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Smith sitting on a wooden chair with his face in a hat|A depiction of Joseph Smith dictating the Book of Mormon through the use of a seer stone placed in a hat to block out light]]In 1828, while scribing for Smith, Harris, at the prompting of his wife [[Lucy Harris]], repeatedly asked Smith to loan him the manuscript pages of the dictation thus far. Smith reluctantly acceded to Harris's requests. Within weeks, Harris lost the manuscript, most likely stolen by a member of his extended family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy Harris&quot;&gt;Harris's wife Lucy Harris was long popularly thought to have stolen the pages. See {{Harvtxt|Givens|2002|p=33}}. Historian Don Bradley contests that this was a rumor that circulated only in retrospect. See {{Harvtxt|Bradley|2019|pp=58‚Äì80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (These are now known as the &quot;[[lost 116 pages]]&quot;.) After the loss, Smith recorded that he lost the ability to translate and that Moroni had taken back the plates to be returned only after Smith repented.{{sfn|Remini|2002|pp=60‚Äì61}}{{sfn|Bushman|2005|p=68}}{{sfn|Givens|2002|p=34}} Smith later stated that God allowed him to resume translation, but directed that he begin where he left off (in what is now called the Book of Mosiah), without retranslating what had been in the lost manuscript.{{sfn|Remini|2002|pp=61‚Äì62}}"

Either/or views of the plates rest on a narrow conception of the materialization process, such that he either dug them up or he did not. Highlighting the crucial role played by those who believed in the reality of the ancient plates suggests a broader view that embeds the recovery of the plates in a process of materialization&quot;.

As a result, when two kayaks move along strong currents, their paths display SDIC. On the other hand, when two kayaks move into a stagnant area, they become trapped, showing no typical SDIC (although a chaotic transient may occur). Such features of SDIC or no SDIC suggest two types of solutions and illustrate the nature of multistability."

Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Encyclopaedia]]'', for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, since he did not quote from it in his ''De temporum ratione''.{{sfn|Laistner|1935|pp=237‚Äì262}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Laistner|1935|pp=263‚Äì266}} provides a list of works definitely or tentatively identified as in Bede's library.}}[[File:The Venerable Bede translates John 1902.jpg|thumb|Cropped portrait from ''The Last Chapter'' by [[J.

They are located on the surface of osteon seams and make a [[protein]] mixture known as [[osteoid]], which mineralizes to become bone.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|pp=189‚Äì190}} The osteoid seam is a narrow region of a newly formed organic matrix, not yet mineralized, located on the surface of a bone. Osteoid is primarily composed of Type I [[collagen]]. Osteoblasts also manufacture [[hormone]]s, such as [[prostaglandin]]s, to act on the bone itself. The osteoblast creates and repairs new bone by actually building around itself. First, the osteoblast puts up collagen fibers. These collagen fibers are used as a framework for the osteoblasts' work. The osteoblast then deposits calcium phosphate which is hardened by [[hydroxide]] and [[bicarbonate]] ions. The brand-new bone created by the osteoblast is called [[osteoid]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington. &quot;The O' Cells.&quot; Bone Cells. The University of Washington, n.d. Web. 3 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the osteoblast is finished working it is actually trapped inside the bone once it hardens. When the osteoblast becomes trapped, it becomes known as an osteocyte. Other osteoblasts remain on the top of the new bone and are used to protect the underlying bone, these become known as bone lining cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wein |first1= Marc N |date=28 April 2017 |title= Bone Lining Cells: Normal Physiology and Role in Response to Anabolic Osteoporosis Treatments|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40610-017-0062-x |journal=Current Molecular Biology Reports |volume=3 |issue= 2|pages= 79‚Äì84 |doi= 10.1007/s40610-017-0062-x|s2cid= 36473110 |access-date=9 November 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

These [[school bus]]es may have [[school bus yellow]] livery and [[School bus crossing arm|crossing guards]]. Other countries may mandate the use of [[seat belts]]. As a minimum, many countries require a bus carrying students to display a [[:Commons:Category:School bus signs|sign]], and may also adopt yellow liveries. Student transport often uses older buses cascaded from service use, retrofitted with more seats or seatbelts. Student transport may be operated by local authorities or private contractors. Schools may also own and operate their own buses for other transport needs, such as class [[field trip]]s or transport to associated sports, music, or other school events."

Blausen 0140 BreastReconstruction TRAM.png,"[[File:Blausen 0140 BreastReconstruction TRAM.png|thumb|Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap (TRAM).]]One option for breast reconstruction involves using the [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] as the donor tissue.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;  As a back muscle, the latissimus dorsi is large and flat and can be used without significant loss of function.  It can be moved into the breast defect while still attached to its blood supply under the arm pit (axilla). A latissimus flap is often used to recruit soft-tissue coverage over an underlying implant; however, if the latissimus flap can provide enough volume, then occasionally it is used to reconstruct small breasts without the need for an implant.  The latissimus dorsi flap has a number of advantages, but despite the advances in surgical techniques, it has remained vulnerable to skin dehiscence or necrosis at the donor site (on the back).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The Mannu flap is a form of latissimus dorsi flap which avoids this complication by preserving a generous subcutaneous fat layer at the donor site and has been shown to be a safe, simple and effective way of avoiding wound dehiscence at the donor site after extended latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mannu GS, Farooq N, Down S, Burger A, Hussien MI | title = Avoiding back wound dehiscence in extended latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction | journal = ANZ Journal of Surgery | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 359‚Äì364 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23088555 | doi = 10.1111/j.1445-2197.2012.06292.x | s2cid = 32228590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"
Blausen 0141 BreastReconstruction TRAM PostOp.png,"[[File:Blausen 0141 BreastReconstruction TRAM PostOp.png|thumb|Post-operative state after Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap(TRAM).]]Another possible donor site for breast reconstruction is the abdomen.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;/&gt;  The TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) flap or its technically distinct variants of microvascular &quot;perforator flaps&quot; like the DIEP/SIEA flaps are all commonly used.  In a TRAM procedure, a portion of the abdominal tissue, which includes skin, subcutaneous fat, minor muscles, and connective tissues, is taken from the patient's abdomen and transplanted to the breast site.  Both TRAM and DIEP/SIEA use the abdominal tissue between the umbilicus (or &quot;belly button&quot;) and the pubis. The [[DIEP flap]] and free-TRAM flap require advanced microsurgical technique and are less common as a result. Both can provide enough tissue to reconstruct large breasts and are a good option for patients who would prefer to maintain their pre-operative breast volume. These procedures are preferred by some breast cancer patients because removal of the donor site tissue results in an [[abdominoplasty]] (tummy tuck) and allow the breast to be reconstructed with one's own tissues instead of a prosthetic implant that uses foreign material.  That said, TRAM flap procedures can potentially weaken the abdominal wall and torso strength, but they are generally well tolerated by most patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;  Perforator techniques such as the DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap and SIEA (superficial inferior epigastric artery) flap require precise dissection of small perforating vessels through the rectus muscle and, thus, do not require removal of abdominal muscle.  Because of this, these flaps have the advantage of maintaining the majority of abdominal wall strength."

Asquith Q 42036.jpg,"One observer, the leading American liberal politician [[William Jennings Bryan]], was enthusiastic about the new Liberal administration, writing that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Great Britain has recently experienced one of the greatest political revolutions she has ever known. The conservative party, with Mr. Balfour, one of the ablest of modern scholars, at its head, and with Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, a powerful orator and a forceful political leader, as its most conspicuous champion, had won a sweeping victory after the Boer war, and this victory, following a long lease of power, led the Conservatives to believe themselves invincible. They assumed, as parties made confident by success often do, that they are indispensable to the nation and paid but little attention to the warnings and threats of the Liberals. One mistake after another, however, alienated the voters and the special elections two years ago began to show a falling off in the Conservative strength, and when the general election was held last fall the Liberals rolled up a majority of something like two hundred in the House of Commons. A new ministry was formed from among the ablest men of the party ‚Äî a ministry of radical and progressive men seldom equaled in moral purpose and intellectual strength.&lt;ref&gt;The Old World and its Ways By Bryan, William Jennings, 1907, P.435&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Asquith Q 42036.jpg|thumb|[[H.

It combines the symbol for &quot;writing tool&quot; or &quot;pen&quot; (a line inclined, as a pen being used) with the symbol for &quot;world&quot;, which in its turn combines &quot;ground&quot; or &quot;earth&quot; (a horizontal line below) and its counterpart derivate &quot;sky&quot; (a horizontal line above). Thus the world would be seen as &quot;what is among the ground and the sky&quot;, and &quot;Blissymbols&quot; would be seen as &quot;the writing tool to express the world&quot;. This is clearly distinct from the symbol of &quot;language&quot;, which is a combination of &quot;mouth&quot; and &quot;ear&quot;. Thus natural languages are mainly oral, while Blissymbols is just a writing system dealing with semantics, not phonetics."
